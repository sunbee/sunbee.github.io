  <p>In King Janaka's time, the custom was not to speak and give advice until asked for,
      and then also, speak only when the one who questions demonstrates a seeking mind, 
      and then also, when the place and time are deemed appropriate. Knowledge flows 
      when there is love as well as respect between the seeker and giver of knowledge. 
      Janaka asks Ashtavakra how can one act with

      To be eligible to receive the Ashtavakra Gita, one must meet the following criteria:<br><br>

      <b>Disciplined body</b>: Listen to the body rather than being carried away by fantasies. 
      Get a moderate amonunt of exercise. Bathe daily and attend to personal hygiene.
      Eat well and consume food that is <em>sattvic</em> and energizing. <em>Live to eat, 
      not eat to live!</em><br><br>

      <b>Courteous speech</b>: Do not speak any harsh words that would create turbulence and turmoil 
      in other lives. Words are like arrows that pierce the heart. If required, a change of tone 
      is enough to assert oneself. <em>Stick and stones may break my bones 
      but words will never hurt me. Right!</em><br><br>
      
      <b>Contemplative mind</b>: Meditate for some time each day, come what may. 
      Perform daily <em>sewa</em>. <em>Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself, 
      but talent instantly recognizes genius.</em><br><br>

      Likes and dislikes are like choosing which of the horns of a dilemma to impale oneself upon.
      Seeming opposites that enthrall with delight or disgust, srping a trap to hold in bondage.
      An atheist is bound to the divine by his very aversion to divinity whereas a devotee is bound by faith. 
      Both sail in the same boat. Acknowledging the root of bondage is the dawning awareness of freedom.
