        The fives senses draw us into the outward world, setting up preferences.
        These preferences become habits. Habits become bondage.
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Taste</b>: Try eating food without salt for a day! 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Sound</b>: We scan radio stations, searching for pleasing music we want to hear again and again.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Smell</b>: We wear perfume, overpowering olfactory senses of those around us 
                while we ourselves stop noticing the scent. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Touch</b>: We carry sexual urges, even into a ripe old age. 
                Even though the body is past it, sex stays in the mind. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Sight</b>: We seek to possess attractive objects.
            </li>
        </ol>
        When we are against a concept, we have no freedom from it. The renunciate who is opposed to sex
        is bound to it by the very opposition and may spend more time than ususal thinking about it.
        Ashtavakra cautions that whatever creates boredom feeds that habit which brings momentary relief.
        Drop it like a poison. But how? 
        <br></br>
        Take nectar by imbibing the qualities as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Shama</b>: Forgive yourself to let go the past. 
                Whatever impressions past events have left, 
                without forgiveness, how will we move past them?
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Arjava</b>: Sincerity is required to move on, once free of the past. 
                Otherwise, forgiveness becomes license to keep repeating the mistakes of the past.
                That leads nowhere. forgiveness is the kindling. Sincerity lights the fire.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Daya</b>: Don't be hard on the self or the other. 
                Recognize the difference between <em>daya</em> and <em>ahmimsa</em>. 
                <em>Daya</em>, compassion, is inclusive and obliterates the difference between self and other.
                <em>Ahmimsa</em>, non-violence, sets up the self versus the other. 
                Without compassion, there is anger and harshness of conduct.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Dosha</b>: What follows compassion is contentment.
                A frustrated person cannot be compassionate,
                towards self or any other. We have set tracks for people
                and we want people to walk those tracks. 
                When a friend or lover springs a surprise, we take affront. 
                Recognize that not one of us will be around for much longer.
                We look at people and events as we want them to be,
                rarely as they are. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Satya</b>: Recognize the impermanence of the body. 
                The body is always changing. And people around us are changing,
                as events flow in a frenzied stream like a swollen river. 
                Change is the only constant. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        These five principles are the golden keys. The right time to apply them is now. 
        Life becomes a pursuit of the unattainable. Wherever we find ourselves, 
        we immediately start looking for what comes next. Scratch an itch
        and that only increases the desire. 
        <br><br>
        Contentment is not antithetical to creativity, it is the mother of creativity!
        The occasional frustration is part of life, like salt is a part of food,
        and adds flavor to the nourishment. Thinking frustration is necessary for creativity 
        is like partaking of salt as if it were food.
        <br><br>
        To imbibe the nectar, there is no better time than now! Nurture these qualities, 
        nourish them.
