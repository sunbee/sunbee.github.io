      King Janaka had a dream in which his kingdom was beset by natural disaster. 
      He was scavenging for scraps of food and found a piece of roti. 
      The custom at the time was that a householder would not sit down to eat 
      until any hungry person in his presence was fed first.<br><br>
      Fearful of losing his sole scrap of food, Janaka hid the roti under his clothes 
      and sought a lonely and desolate place to sit down and eat. Even then, 
      an eagle swooped down upon him and snatched the roti just as he was about to eat. 
      Desperate, he cried out loud in his dream and woke up to find himself 
      in his royal court, surrounded by courtiers. <br><br>
      Being a thoughtful person, Janaka wondered whether he had woken up 
      from a frightening dream into pleasant reality or escaped from harsh reality 
      into a pleasant dream. His questioning nature led him to seek answers 
      from wise men and women in his kingdom, ultimately leading him to Ashtavakra, 
      the <em>brahma-gyani</em>, who had attained knowledge of the <em>brahman</em>, 
      the ultimate reality.<br><br>
      The ensuing conversation between one in the prime of life
      thirsting to learn about reality, and one at the pinnacle of wisdom giving the knowledge,
      is <b>Ashtavakra Gita</b>, the song of reality. Unlike the <b>Bhagvad Gita</b>, 
      where Krishna gave the highest knowledge to the seeker Arjuna in the heat of battle, 
      this exchange transpired in a royal residence, in a peaceful, joyous atmosphere.
