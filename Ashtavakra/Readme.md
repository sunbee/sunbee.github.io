## Ashtavakra Gita
The Ashtavakra Gita app in App Inventor uses this Github page in the WebView component as a scaffold.
The app serves up 33 quizzes, one for each video on Ashtavakra Gita by Sri Sri Ravishankar, founder
of the Art of Living, one of the largest volunteer-based non-profit organizations in the world.
The HTML files with quiz content are assets local to the app and used to flesh out this scaffold.
Interactivity is supported by Javascript features like data-bindings. JS is made available as CDN
via github pages: AshtavakraJS.

The app is companion to the SPA.
